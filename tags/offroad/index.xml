      <description>Today I went for Mountain Biking trip which is organized by SUOC. I&amp;rsquo;ve done mountain biking when I was in Indonesia almost every weekend. At first I was wondering where can I have good trails for mountain biking in Syracuse. The area is located near Syracuse University south campus. To give you better sense of direction, look at the map below.
 I don&amp;rsquo;t have a decent bike for mountain biking and never go for mountain biking with complete equipment but this time was different.</description>
