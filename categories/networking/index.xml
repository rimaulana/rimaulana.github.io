      <description>Tonight, I replaced one of my network interfaces in my computer. I changed the old one, which is Fast Ethernet type, with the new one, which is Gigabit type. I was working in my Ubuntu server 11.04. When I finished replacing the interface. I turned my computer on to see will it work. I found that the new interface didn”t work. When I plugged the cable in, the LED indicator simply didn”t light.</description>
